<p>Skoda Auto India Private Limited is an Indian subsidiary of Europe''s number one automaker, Volkswagen. Skoda Works was established as an arms manufacturer in 1859, but did not develop automobiles. The company started off by manufacturing bicycles. The fall of communism with the Velvet Revolution brought great changes to Czechoslovakia, and most industries were subject to privatisation. In the case of Skoda Automobile the government brought in a strong foreign partner. Volkswagen was chosen in 1990 and, in April, 1991, Skoda became the fourth brand of the Volkswagen Group.

Backed by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design - both style and engineering - has improved greatly. Skoda has been in India for almost a decade and enjoys a premium position among its competitors. Skoda came to India with Octavia in 2002. Octavia is still sold in India but sadly Skoda hasn''t updated it in all these years. Octavia''s Estate version and the Octavia Combi could not attract attention of the consumers and hence these were withdrawn by the company.

By 2005 Skoda was selling over 30,000 cars a year in the UK, a market share of over 1%. For the first time in its UK history, a waiting list developed for deliveries by the company. Skoda owners in the UK have consistently ranked the brand at or near the top of the J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey during the 2000s.
